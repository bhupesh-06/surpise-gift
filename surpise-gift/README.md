A Little Surprise for My Girlfriend

The part that needs modification is the index.html file.

It has been found that setting the date to the month when you "like her" will cause issues.

I have to remind you, for those who come to fork this, this is not my original work.

I saw this on a purely front-end design website, found it interesting, and decided to bring the repository over. Randomly, my roommate discovered this page and used it. His girlfriend also liked it. However, unexpectedly, she was watching short videos, and in one of them, a guy was coding on a computer, and the screen shown was exactly this repository’s page. I advise everyone: don’t claim it as your own original work. If you really get caught, it could be troublesome.
